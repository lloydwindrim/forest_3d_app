- make sure setup.sh and /custom_setup are in darknet root dir
- run from terminal:  ./setup.sh
- edit header of auto_setup_yolo.sh (addresses of darknet root, images and annotations)
- run in terminal: ./auto_setup_yolo.sh


>>might want to set the number of epochs (i.e. max_batches). Guide:
max_batches=2000*num_classes*(64/train_bs)   # train_bs currently set to 16
steps=0.8*max_batches,0.9*max_batches

>>currently setup for classes: tree, shrub and partial. If want to use different classes, make sure to change in yolov3-tiny-custom.cfg and yolov3-tiny-custom-test.cfg:
lines 127: filters=(num_classes + 5)*3
line 135: classes=num_classes
line 171: filters=(num_classes + 5)*3
line 177: classes=num_classes
**These are the yolo detection heads


>>notes on compiling darknet:
- set gpu=1 in makefile
- make
- when using (e.g. to train or test), switch to sudo user
